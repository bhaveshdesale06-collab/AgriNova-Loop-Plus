# AgriNova Loop+

## Overview
AgriNova Loop+ is a low-cost, no-hardware decision-support smart farming platform designed for small and marginal farmers. It optimizes irrigation practices and enables community-level circular utilization of crop residues.

## Problem Statement
Small farmers face water wastage, crop residue burning, and high energy costs. Existing smart farming solutions depend on expensive hardware and isolated farm-level deployment, making them impractical for rural India.

## Solution
The platform generates irrigation advisories using farmer inputs and weather data. It also enables village-level pooling of crop residues, which are converted into compost or biogas and redistributed to farmers.

## System Workflow
1. Farmer inputs crop details
2. Weather data is fetched
3. Irrigation advisory is generated
4. Residue data recorded after harvest
5. Residue pooled at community level
6. Compost/biogas redistributed

## Circular Economy Model
Crop residue is reused as compost or biogas, closing the loop between waste and production.

## Sustainability Impact
- Water savings: 30–40%
- Residue burning reduction: ~60%
- Energy savings: 20–25%

## Feasibility
Works with basic smartphones and existing data sources, making it scalable and affordable.
